# Plaso Android SMS Parser Plugin

This plugin is designed to parse and process Android SMS message data within the Plaso framework. It extracts key information such as the sender, receiver, message content, timestamp, and message type. Using custom event data classes, the plugin structures the parsed data to integrate smoothly with Plasoâ€™s timeline generation.
